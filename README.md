# How to Zero

You measure and adjust **USING THE RETICLE**. You DO NOT NEED convert `[ MIL|MOA ] --> [yards|meters|centimeters|bananas|] --> [ MIL|MOA ]`



**Context**

My setup (don't think this matters but it might so including it):
* Bergara B14 HMR in 6.5 
* Optic
    * Vortex Viper PST Gen II 5-25x50 FFP
    * Vortex precision matched rings - 0.97 inches
    * 20 MOA base 
* Turner Sling

My "experience":
* Above setup is my first rifle, have been to the range 3 times, shot a total of 120 rounds.

Questions:
1. **When should I confirm my Zero and when should I re-Zero?**
* I presume the answer to these is: "Confirm your zero every time you change ammo and/or setup, re-zero when it seems off." Is this presumption correct?
2. **How much "intra-ammunition variability" should one expect?**
* Assuming the setup doesn't change, if you buy 1,000 rounds ammo A, and only shoot ammo A, surely you shouldn't need to
  confirm your zero every time you go to the range right? If this is the case, can
3. **How to not "Chase Zero"?**
* One of the youtube channels in the wiki has a video where he says, *"You don't want to chase your zero...You don't want
  to be putting a click on here, taking a click of there...you can spend all day and two boxes of ammo an not really get
  zeroed."* This is, quite literally, what I did today. How does one know if a bad group is due to user error (I would
  expect this to be the case since I'm a beginner) or due to ammo variability?
