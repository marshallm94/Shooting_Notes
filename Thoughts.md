# Meta-Notes

* The "title" of each note has the format "( <date> ) <problem/thought/question>". The date component refers to the date the
  problem/thought/question popped up and does *not* imply the thought process/answer below the title was reached in one
  day. In fact, it is usually the case that the thought process/answer that is developed underneath the title was
  reached over multiple days.
* Additionally, *coherence* is not only not a requirement, it is rarely achieved. these notes can be incomplete
  sentences, random thoughts that trail off, etc. The notes are a means to and end, not the end itself.

## ( 2022-11-13 ): Zeroing with MILs

(The following assumes a FFP scope in MILs)

* When you are making adjustments *at a fixed distance*, **you do not need to convert MILs to inches, centimeters, or
  any other non-angular measurement to zero your system.**

For example:
1. If you aim at the red diamond, and the shot ends up at the green circle, then you need to adjust your reticle such
   that the center is 1 MIL up and 1.5 MILs right of where it was when you pressed the trigger. Assuming your scope makes
   adjustments in 0.1 MILs, then this would be:

   ```
   <desired_total_adjustment_in_MILs> / <unit_of_click_in_MILs> = <total_clicks_to_adjust>
   1 MIL / 0.1 = 10 clicks up
   1.5 MILs / 0.1 = 15 clicks right
   ```
   * This is true if you are zeroing at 100 yards or meters, 200 yards or meters, 654 yards or meters. 
   * **At no point do you need to convert measurements that aren't in MILs.**
